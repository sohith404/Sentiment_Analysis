Restaurant-Reviews-Analysis
Using Natural Language Processing and Bag of Words for feature extraction for sentiment analysis of the customers visited in the Restaurant and at last using Classification algorithm to separate Positive and Negative Sentiments.

Natural language processing is a subfield of computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human languages, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

## Details
-From this Dataset, To Perform NLP Project, I decided to take "Review" and "Rating columns".

-Later after performing Pre-Processing, I converted "Rating" Column, which is actually a numerical column, into the column that has two labels "Positive" and "Negative".

-I considered Rating Above 3 as "Positive" and Below 3 as "Negative" and 3 as "Neutral".

-Graphical representation of the sentiment is also done.

-Performed  feature extraction using methods such as Count Vectorization, term frequencies and inverse document frequencies, natural language toolkit.

-Further, I have used Classification algorithms like KNN and Naive Bayes to separate different sentiments for better business world understandings and evaluated the models to find their accuracy.
